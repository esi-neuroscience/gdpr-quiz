# Introduction

With some text
People who participate in our studies trust us with their data, so it is our
job to make sure that the data is not used in ways that they do not agree
with.

In the EU, the handling of personal information is governed by the
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). You can find the full text 
[here](https://gdpr-info.eu/">gdpr-info.eu)

1. Sounds good!

> Click the lightbulb for a hint!

# What is Personal Data?

GDPR only applies to personal data. If data can not be linked (neither directly
nor indirectly) to a person, it is called anonymous. Anonymous data is not
covered by the GDPR.

Which of these statements about personal data are correct (click all that apply)?

- [x] Full name and address are personal data. 

    > Full name and address are always personal data
    
- [ ] Averages and standard deviations of a large dataset are personal data.

    > Aggregated data are typically not personal data
    
- [x] Averages and standard deviations can be personal data if the dataset is too small.

    > If the number of participants is too low, even aggregate data can allow you to infer information about individual people 
    
- [x] Data that are stored under a pseudonym are still personal data, even if the list that maps pseudonyms to names is stored separately

    > As long as it is still possible to link the data back to individual people, it is not anonymous
    
- [x] MRI brain scans on their own, without any name or ID, can still be personal data

    > Brain scans can be personal data on their own. The process of *defacing* is meant to reduce the amount of personal data while keeping the relevant data for research intact. Whether that works for a particular scan is not easy to answer though
      
- [x] If you know who participated in a study, but not who gave which answers, demographic data like age and gender can be sufficient to match data to individual participants 

    > Age and gender alone are often sufficient to find out which member of the group gave these answers

> A hint

# What's the capital of Germany?

> It's the _largest_ city in Germany...

- [x] Berlin
    > this is the correct answer.
- [ ] Frankfurt
- [ ] Paris
    > Paris is the capital of France.
- [ ] Cologne


# Python Lists

What is the value of `x[2]`?

> Python lists are mutable!

~~~python
x = [2, 3, 4]
x[2] = 4
print(x[2])
~~~

- [ ] 1
- [ ] 2
- [ ] 3
- [x] 4

## The sound of dog

What do dogs sound like?

> Some hint

- [ ] yes
- [ ] no
- [ ] `self.sound = "meow"`
- [x] wuff
